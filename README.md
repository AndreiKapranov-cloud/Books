# books

NodeJS

We'we got three tables:books,languages and localization.
Table 'books' keeps the name of the book.
Table 'languages':three languages:PL,RU,BY.
Table 'localization':localized names of the books.This table is not fully completed,completed only for some books and languages.

You should make output of information about books for concrete language.
If we'we got localization of the book name for this language-then use it.If not-use default name.

Use NodeJS with Express server for rendering html page.
